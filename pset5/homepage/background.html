                            I was born and raised in Tulsa, OK as the oldest of 4 brothers.
                            Growing up we had the typical rambunctions lifestyle of 4 boys and drove our parents, specifically our mother, crazy.
                            Tulsa was a great place to grow up, it has some of the big city perks without the big city headaches.
                            It has a pretty ideal amount of small town charm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My mom was also born and raised in Tulsa so we had plenty of familly nearby.
                            I am very close with my cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents and try to visit as often as I can.
                            My dad, on the other hand, is from Buffalo, NY. Growing up we would all hop in the car and drive the 20 hours to go see all the family on that side.
                            As much as I hated the car rides, the time spent with family made it all worth it.
                            I try to keep in touch will all my family on my dad's side, who are spread all over the country (my dad has 29 first cousins!).

                            After graduating high school, I matriculated down the turnpike to the University of Oklahoma in Norman.
                            There I studied Petroleum Engineering with a minor in Economics.
                            I had a tremendous experience at OU, where I worked through a challenging curriculum, learned valuable life skills, and made lifelong friends.
                            I even introduced my neighbor to a good friend from high school, who ended up getting married and I officiated their wedding!
                        <p>
                            After the OU I continued my education at Harvard's Ivy League rival Cornell.
                            There I studied Energy Economics and Engineering, which was a natural extension of my studies at OU.
                            It was a fascinating course of study, and I was excited to learn about all the various energy systems outside the petroleum industry.
                            It set me up for a great start to my career and has allowed me to envision a career path outside the petroleum industry.

                            I began my career with Apache Corporation, an upstream oil and gas producer based out of Houston.
                            I spent the first 3 years rotating to different offices and disciplines to get an understanding of the business.
                            I started in the Tulsa office, worked in western Oklahoma for a short time, and eventually moved to Houston to finish off my training.
                            The past 4.5 years I have spent in San Antonio working as a production engineer, with plans to move in December back to Houston to begin work as a data engineer.
                            I am excited about the opportunity and the challenge of starting work in a new field, I hope that I can continue to grow and learn to further my career in whatever comes next.
