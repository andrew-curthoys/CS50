                        One of my favorite activities is traveling. I am passionate about getting to know about other parts of the world and experiencing other cultures.

                            As one of 4 children, most of our travels when I was a kid were throughout the US in our family's minivan.
                            We took innumerable trips to Buffalo to see my dad's side of the family and typically a ski trip every year to New Mexico.
                            These ski trips were where I gained an appreciation for Marty Robbins and Johnny Cash.

                            After graduating college, I have had the opportunity to travel outside the US.
                            Some of my favorite trips have been to South America for skiing, multiple places in the Caribbean for SCUBA diving, and a work trip to Istanbul and Cairo.
                            Unfortunately we could not see many sights in Cairo due to security reasons but Istanbul was one of the most remarkable cities I have ever seen.
                            The history, culture, food, and its place as the crossroads between Europe and Asia makes it one of the most unique and fascinating places on Earth.

                            I recently returned from Australia for my cousin's wedding.
                            We spent a few days in Perth for the wedding, then took a trip up to a small town on the Ningaloo Reef called Exmouth, where the bride's brother lives and owns a brewery.
                            We spent a few days on the beach, I took a ride on a microlight glider, went SCUBA diving, and enjoyed a number of delicious cold beers brewed by my new cousin-in-law!

                            After jaunting around the west coast we went to Sydney for a few days to explore the Harbour City.
                            It was an unbelievable time, my favorite activities were hiking to the top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and touring the Sydney Opera House.
                            Both structures are awe inspiring engineering and architectural marvels, which are a testament to the ingenuity and unlimited potential of the human spirit.

                            Overall it was one of the best trips I've ever been on. I am so glad I had the opportunity to make it to Australia and explore the other side of the world with friends and family.
                            When I first stepped off our 17 hour flight to begin our trip to Australia I thought there was absolutely no way I was going to do that again.
                            However, after spending 2 weeks in their magnificent country, I can't wait to get back & ask some Australians "how ya goin?"
