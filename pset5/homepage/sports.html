                        Another passion of mine is sports. Growing up, I played sports all year round, whether organized sports or horsing around with my brothers in the front yard.
                        Every year when the schedules are released I circle a few games to attend to root on my team.

                            Sports have been a part of my life ever since I can remember.
                            I grew up in Oklahoma, where there are no major professional sports teams, so I was raised on University of Tulsa football and basketball.
                            The University of Oklahoma won the National Championship in college football when I was 12, and I ended up watching them play in a National Championship when I was a student there 8 years later.
                            Sadly they lost to Tim Tebow and the Florida Gators.

                            I became accustomed to seeing my teams lose on the big stage at a young age, as my dad is from Buffalo and raised me with the affliction of being a Buffalo sports fan.
                            To start the 90s the Bills lost 4 Super Bowls in a row, the last two of which I remember because I was too young for the first two.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So my sports fandom is pretty eccentric, with a mix of Buffalo and Oklahoma teams and the St Louis Cardinals.
                            I typically try to make it to a few games a year for each team, it works out pretty well because I have a really big family with cousins all over the country.
                            Every game I go to there's a chance I have a cousin or relative nearby.
                            Our team may win or lose but the opportunity to see family always makes it worth it.
